Hi, I'm Karim! I'm a senior studying computer science at UC Berkeley with a passion for building software. I have direct experience writing production-level code and tests developing the flagship product at Alteryx during my internship and in full-stack web development building my daily game **[relatle](https://github.com/karimkaylani/relatle)**. I also have a passion for teaching with experience as a TA for Berkeley’s CS 88 and I'm a big music lover from playing guitar to going to concerts.
